# COVID-19 Cases Predictions by date

As a University student who loves to plan ahead, the awaiting announcement of schools being reopened is dreadful. Experts have stated that once a country achieve herd immunity, 
restrictions can be lifted, meaning a higher possibility of going back to school. Depending on the disease, herd immunity can consist of 95% of the population vaccinated (measles) 
or 80% (polio) (World Health Organization). In this repo, I will be analyzing past data on country progression in COVID-19 vaccinations to predict the percentage of population
vaccinated given a certain date.
